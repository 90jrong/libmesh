% This paper cites libmesh and the Google Alert blurb says "algorithm is implemented using libMesh" but I have not been able to actually download it.
% The DOI was not live when I originally clicked on it.
% This looks like a journal that used to be published by Cambridge University Press but has now been taken over by a Chinese publisher?
